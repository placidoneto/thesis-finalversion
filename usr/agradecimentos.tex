	When I started my Ph.D. studies back in 2008, I couldn't imagine how to 
	write a thesis. For me it seemed to be an impossible endeavor. However, thanks
	to the will of God I finished the text of this thesis. So, I want to express my
	gratitude to God for this gift, because without him it would not be possible.  
	
% 	It is the great
% 	support from many people that contributed to making it possible.
	 
	Now I have the opportunity to thank many people who helped me in some
	way, so, I can't forget anyone of them. I will try to do that. During my Ph.D.
	I had really nice and lovely people around me, and I thank for the ``gifts''
	(mainly that ones you feel) and unforgetable moments were passed near them. I
	found new friends and rediscovered old ones. These things, only a God that
	loves you can provide.    
	
	I'm grateful to my supervisor Prof. Martin Musicante, not only for the ongoing
	support but also for believing in me during this time and for the opportunities
	he provided for my growth as a researcher. I deeply thank my co-supervisor
	Prof. Genoveva Vargas-Solar for the time and effort spent on my thesis and for the feedback
	and support when I was in Mexico and France, and even by many emails and
	meetings by conference when I came back to Brazil. I also would like to thank
	Prof. Valeria de Castro for the patience and suggestions given for my
	work and for the friendship during the short time we had contact. I hope to
	cooperate with everyone for a long time, because I know that many fruits can be harvested yet.
	
	I also would like to thank the committee members (Prof. Nelson Souto Rosa
	(UFPE), Prof. Silvia Virg\'ilio (UFPR), Prof. M\'arcia Lucena (UFRN) and
	Prof. Valeria de Casto (URJC)) who agreed to read, analyze and comment this
	thesis. Thank you very much for your contributions!
	
	I was pleased to be part of the HADAS team for 9 months and meet people
	who I will always remember with nostalgia and affection, in particular Juan
	Carlos, Mohamad Othman, Epal Orleans, Carlos Manuel (Manolo), Lourdez
	Martinez, Christiane Kamdem, Leon Fopa and Javier Espinosa. Thanks for the
	friendship. I hope to have the opportunity to meet everyone again in some
	place of the world.
	
	I am also grateful to Diego Caminha. A friend who I have great respect
	and affection and who now I consider like a brother. Thanks for had received me
	in France. I'm happy to have you as a friend and I miss our conversations and
	the  good moments we spent. God bless you.  
	
	I am deeply grateful to Marinas Praia Sul Presbyterian Church (IPMPS) members
	for their support, prayers and love of each one. They are always by my
	side, I thank the church members and its amiable council. Likewise, I
	thank my father-in-law Luiz Machado, my mother-in-law Maria de Lourdez, my sister-in-law Ana Tereza and my brother-in-law Heliomar
	Dias, for being always ready to help with your prayers and actions. 

	My family has been my greatest supporter over the last 29 years. My mother Ana
	Sueli is the better and coolest mother I can imagine and I am deeply grateful
	for everything she did for me. I hope be like her as a father. I also thank my
	father Francisco Ednaldo and my sister Tatyanny Nascimento that always took
	care and pray for me. Thanks for being there!
	
	Last but not least, I am very happy to have my own little family that strongly
	supported me in my Ph.D. studies. My beloved wife Ana Fl\'avia always
	supporting me, even during the countless weekends in the office, and the 9
	months I spent in Grenoble for the Ph.D. stage. I am very thankful for her
	love, help and support in many dificult times. My son Lucas Kauai has been the
	sunshine in my life for the last 2 years. I am not able to measure the love I
	feel for them, not only for what they have done for me, but for what they are
	and represent in my life. I love you two with all my heart.
	
	Thank you so much!
